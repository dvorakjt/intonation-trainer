each instrument should have a range
when pitches are being selected for ascending intervals, the lowest note of the interval should be >= the lowest note of the
range of the instrument to play that note, and <= the upper range of the second instrument minus the interval
this is the possible range of the exercise
a starting note will be randomly selected from this range, and then the second note will be created based on the interval
accidentals will be decided randomly
